# CodeMirror-minified
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Dominator008/CodeMirror-minified.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Dominator008/CodeMirror-minified) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/codemirror-minified.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/codemirror-minified)

## About
This is a minified [CodeMirror 5](https://codemirror.net/5) distribution. All JavaScript files have been minified with [Google Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler) using `SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS`, and all CSS files have been minified with [clean-css](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css). This projects has CodeMirror's main repository as a Git submodule and is released once per CodeMirror release using the same version number.

This distribution contains only the `addon`, `keymap`, `lib`, `mode` and `theme` directories. Within them, only non-test JavaScript and CSS files are included. See the ["files"](https://github.com/Dominator008/CodeMirror-minified/blob/master/package.json#L10-L22) section in `package.json` for the list of things included.

## Instructions
Just use this as if you were using the original CodeMirror library. All minified files retain their original name and location relative to CodeMirror's project root directory.

An NPM package is available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/codemirror-minified. Install with:
```sh
npm install codemirror-minified
```

## Building it Yourself
We use Gulp:
```sh
git submodule update --init
npm install
gulp
```
